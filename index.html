    <li>week 1: I was so terrified, i was a fresher , just out of college 
        and I landed here, ofcource Fortunate enough for me, but yes
        I was anxious and nervous. 
        <br><br> 
    </li>
    <li>week 2:Things got a bit settled, first time in my life I started to 
        learn without jotting anything down. It was going good
        <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>week 3; I got used to meetings and typings, and sessions . 
        I felt lucky to be Here
        <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>week 4: Then came the review and yes , I was again back to 
        week one. anxious, terrified and low . Guess what I got a 
        good reviewer, or for that matter, My review went well
