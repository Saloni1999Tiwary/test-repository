        <h1>CSS Basics</h1>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
            CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
            CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
            External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</p>

            <div>
                <h2> What else </h2>
                <p>This is a demonstration of how
                 different stylesheets can change the layout of your HTML page.</p>

            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>This is a heading.</li>
                <li>This is a paragraph.</li>
                <h2>Inline elements</h2>
                <p>Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags
                 defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content</p>
            </ul>
